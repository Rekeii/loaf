## **Welcome**

This is my *little* repository of my notes-wherein I attempt to explain concepts to myself to the best of my ability so that I, or common people can understand. As such, you might see longer notes for theories when it could be explained succinctly. 

My name is *Vin,* welcome to my repository. 

> [!danger] Note for me...
> Here's a *cheers* and *prayer,* that this will be the **last** and **final** repository. Perfection is truly the enemy.
