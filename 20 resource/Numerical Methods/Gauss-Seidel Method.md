**Gauss-Seidel Method** is similar to [[Gauss-Jacobi Method]] however, they vary in its substitution process. With [[Gauss-Jacobi Method]], they substitute after every iteration, but in **Gauss-Seidel Method** you substitute every time you solve for an unknown. *See the graphical representation as follows:*

Their operations and steps are the same except for the substitution process. Simply note the substitution process and you will be fine.
