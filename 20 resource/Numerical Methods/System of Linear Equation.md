There are several techniques that you may employ when solving linear equations. There are two kinds of techniques, **Direct Methods,** and **Iterative Methods**

**Direct Methods:**
- Matrix Decomposition
	- [[Crout’s or Cholesky’s Method]]
	- [[Doolittle Method]]

Iterative Methods:
- [[Gauss-Jacobi Method]]
- [[Gauss-Seidel Method]]
- [[Successive Over Relaxation]]
