## Complex Number 
is a number in a **form** of $C = a+jb$ where $a$ and $b$ are **real** and $j=\sqrt{ -1 }$ is the **imaginary** part. In electrical engineering, we use the letter $j$ as the letter $i$ has heavy use as the symbol current ($i$).

- Geometric Representation - complex numbers are represented geometrically in two forms. The x-axis : *real axis*, y-axis : *imaginary axis*.
