Voltage or *potential difference* is the amount of energy (or work) required to move a unit charge from a reference point (-) to a another point (+), measured in volts. This work done to move these electrons in a particular direction is performed by an external electromotive force (emf), this is usually our batteries.

Since this is work, we can mathematically show this as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{ab} \triangleq \frac{dw}{dq}
\end{aligned}
$$
Wherein, w is energy in joules (J) and q is charge in coulombs (C). This shows that voltage is the rate of work per unit charge. This means that 1 volt is the required energy to move 1 coulomb of charge. **1 volt = 1 joule/coulomb or 1 newton-meter/coulomb**

Now, it is important to note that the sign convention is simply ways to define the reference direction or voltage polarity. This means that when voltage is measured from positive to negative, *voltage drop*, it is positive ($V_{ab}$) while when it is measured from negative to positive, *voltage rise,* it is negative ($V_{ba}$). Obeying the following:
$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{ab} = -v_{ab}
\end{aligned}
$$
There are two types of voltages, [[Direct Current ||DC Voltage]] and [[Alternating Current||AC Voltage]]. DC is what we call a constant voltage and is commonly produced by a battery. While an AC voltage is a sinusoidal time-varying voltage that is produced by an electric generator.
