is a quantity of **electric energy** that is usually stored in batteries, [[Capacitor |capacitors]], [[Elementary Particles |elementary particles]] (think electrons, protons, etc.), or any insulated materials. It is the **most basic** quantity in an [[Electric Circuit|electric circuit]].  This quantity is a property of matter that can be observed to apply force when matter steps into any electromagnetic field *(i.e., like charges repelling and unlike charges attracting).* 

> [!faq]- What is its relation to [[Electric Fields |electric fields?]]
> As we know, electromagnetic waves are simply present on its own everywhere in nature. However, they naturally do not carry any sort of charges unlike electric fields. I make this distinction now so we do not confuse ourselves between electromagnetic waves and fields.

Electric charge is measured in coulombs ($C$), and is usually symbolized with the letter q, depending whether it is a constant quantity ($Q$) or instantaneous quantity ($q$).

Now charge is inherently a large quantity, in fact: $1C = 6.24\cdot 10^{18}$ electrons.

> [!info] Law of Conservation of Charge
> This law states that charge can **neither be created nor destroyed**, only **transformed**. Thus, this means that the algebraic sum of charges must always equal the same amount. This law explains why electric charge is a **conserved property.**

Now electric charge can be expressed in various ways, positive, neutral, or negative, depending on their net charge. Atoms are building blocks of matter and these atoms carry protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles all have their own individual values of charges:

- Proton: $e = 1.60217662\cdot 10^{-19}C$
- Electron: $-e = -1.60217662\cdot 10^{-19}C$

If you notice, all the charges are simply multiples of the elementary charge $e$, charges of these particles must only be a whole number multiple of elementary charge. Additionally, neutral atoms do not contain any electric charge as they have equal number of protons and electrons, thus they cancel each other out.
