> **Voltage Division**, when considering which resistors to use, consider the resistors leading up to the node or voltage you're measuring to. Hence why, V1 and V2 uses R1 and R2. Similarly, V3 uses R3 and R4. All the resistors chosen lead up to the node or point you're measuring.

> Note! Voltage node is equivalent to the voltage source's value if the voltage source is at the **periphery** **AND** the node in question IS **directly connected** to the voltage source.

### Chapter 3: Circuit Analysis Methods, 3.4 Mesh Analysis
Mesh analysis uses KVL, thus our working eqn would be, V=IR
