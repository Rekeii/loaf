A resistor is a **passive two-terminal** element or component wherein its main function is to typically either limit the amount of current passing through **OR** divide the voltage in a circuit. 

A resistor's value is measured in **ohms** ($\Omega$), [[Electrical Resistance |electrical resistance]], volt per ampere. They are typically symbolized through the following:

## **How does it work?**

Now, if you want to delve into how this *usually* small piece of hardware works and allows us to stop or limit current from flowing, see below. This section will focus on its application in circuits.

An ideal resistor will obey [[Ohm's Law]],
$$V = IR$$
- $V$ - Voltage ($V$)
- $I$ - Current ($A$)
- $R$ -  Resistance ($\Omega$)

Wherein resistance is directly proportional to voltage but inversely proportional to current. Why? Recall that resistance *limits* current, hence current will decrease as resistance increases.


## [**What kinds are out there?**](https://www.electricaltechnology.org/2015/01/resistor-types-resistors-fixed-variable-linear-non-linear.html)
A basic resistor can first be categorized into Linear and Non-linear:
### Linear Resistors
These are resistors where its values **will not** change and will always provide the same amount of resistance regardless of the inputted voltage. These resistors obey [[Ohm's Law]].

### Non Linear Resistors
These are resistors wherein the current **does not change** according to **ohm's law,** but rather to external factors such as temperature or applied voltage. This kind of resistor **does not obey ohm's law**.
- **Thermistors**
- **Varisters (VDR)**
- **Photo Resistor or Photo Conductive Cell or LDR**
