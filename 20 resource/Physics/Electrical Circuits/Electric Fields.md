Referencing Coulomb's Law, electric field is the magnitude of force between two charged bodies is proportional to the charges Q and q and inversely proportional to the distance squared; 
$$F = \frac{1}{4\pi ε}\left( \frac{Qq}{r^2} \right)$$
Where, $ε$ is [[Permittivity |permittivity]] of the medium. The permittivity of free space, $ε_{0}$ is as follows:
$$ε_{0} = \frac{1}{4\pi c^2 10^{-7}}\left( \frac{F}{m} \right) = 8.8541878176 \cdot  10^{-12}\left( \frac{F}{m} \right)$$
