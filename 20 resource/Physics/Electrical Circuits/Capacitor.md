A capacitor is a **passive two-terminal** element or component that **stores [[Electrical Energy |electrical energy]]** using two conductor plates separated by an [[Insulator |insulator]] 
([[Dielectric |dielectric]])

A capacitors' value is measured in **farads** ($F$), [[Electrical Capacitance |electrical capacitance]], volt per ampere. They are typically symbolized through the following:
