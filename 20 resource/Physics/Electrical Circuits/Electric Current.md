Electric current is the time rate of change of charge measured in *amperes ($A$)*. Current is intrinsically linked with [[Electric Fields ||electric fields]]. Mathematically, we can express their relationship as such:
$$
\begin{aligned}
i \triangleq \frac{dq}{dt}
\end{aligned}
$$
Where 1 ampere = 1 coulomb/second. This mathematical expression tells us that current can be expressed as either a constant-valued function or time-varying function. Hence, we can use this for both [[Direct Current]] and [[Alternating Current]].

Direct Current is constant and flows in only one direction and its magnitude can vary through time (maybe environmental factors such as temperature). It is only considered Alternating Current when it changes direction with respect to time, oscillating between positive and negative.

The direction of current is defined as the direction of positive charges. 

It is also important to note that electric **current cannot happen without [[Voltage||voltage]].** Voltage is the measurement of what drives charges to move in a circuit while current measures the movement. Voltage pushes the charges and this push creates current to flow throughout the circuit. How can current happen when there is no voltage source? It is *impossible*.
