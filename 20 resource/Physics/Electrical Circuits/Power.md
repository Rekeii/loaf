Power is defined as the time rate of expending (losing) or absorbing energy, measured in **watts ($W$)**. It is rate at which energy is being transferred or converted. The relationship between energy to [[Voltage|voltage]] and [[Electric Current|current]] can be shown mathematically as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p = \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{dw}{dq} \cdot \frac{dq}{dt} =  vi \\ 
p = vi
\end{aligned}
$$
Power obeys the **[[Passive Sign Convention|passive sign convention]] (PSC)** wherein, when current enters through the positive terminal of an element, $p = +vi$. If current enters through the negative terminal, $p = -vi$. In other words, whichever terminal the current enters first will determine the sign convention of power.

Additionally, power obeys the **Law of Conservation of Energy** wherein, the algebraic sum of power in a circuit, at any instant of time, must be zero:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum p = 0
\end{aligned}
$$
This means that the ==Power Absorbed (+) is equivalent to Power Supplied (-)==.
